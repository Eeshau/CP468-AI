# For all intersection nodes there is a delay TDelay â†’ There can only be one car at each intersection node. Delay of 3
# For all edges there is another delay C% which is based off of how many cars are traversing that specific edge. Delay of +1% each car sharing the same edge.
# Following the papers values: the node delay is set to 3, the edge multiplier is number of vehicles as a percent
# Each vehicle=1%
# Don't need to do 3* the amount of vehicles on the intersection because there will only be one vehicle at an intersection at a given time. (3*1=3)
# Visited is a set of nodes that have been visited
# Graph is a dictionary of all the nodes
# To add an edge we add the (x,y) to the nodes neighbors array
